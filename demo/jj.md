npm init
then we put all settings

1. `node filename.js` – run file

2. We added new command "start" to the `package.json`
   then we can run this command directly through 'npm run start'

3. require and import
   `module.exports` - to export and import elements (through `require`)

4. localhost:7000/greeting-page?name=tom – to show with TOM

5. params vs queries:
   params cannot be left empty,
   queries: value is optional
